# I'm Jacob

I'm a Canadian developer with a special interest in **web-based applications** and **server administration**. Currently
enrolled in the Computer Programmer Analyst program at [Fanshawe College](http://fanshawec.ca/) in London, ON, Canada,
I will be graduating in December 2016. This is a co-operative education program, which means that I get valuable work
experience while still enrolled in school.

I have experience working with

* Python
* PHP
* Java
* C++
* C#/.NET
* JavaScript
* HTML5/CSS3
* SQL
* Go
* Docker and LXC containers
* Markdown, reStructuredText, YAML, and more
