## Projects

I'll be populating this page with any projects I work on, including a brief description of what they are.

### keepup <sup>[Source](https://github.com/parryjacob/keepup) | [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/keepup)</sup>

`keepup` is a simple utility for keeping a predefined set of tasks, in the format of an `Upfile`, running. Providing a
curses interface and the ability to view stdout, stderr, and the ability to send input to stdin, this utility is
inspired by [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) and [Honcho](https://github.com/nickstenning/honcho), a Python
port of Foreman.

### Settlers of Catan <sup>[Source](https://github.com/parryjacob/settlers-of-catan)</sup>

This is an unfinished clone of the Settlers of Catan game, written using Fabric and node.js.

### ModuleBukkit <sup>[Source](https://github.com/parryjacob/ModuleBukkit)</sup>

`ModuleBukkit` is a plugin written for the (essentially) defunct [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org) project (a Minecraft server
implementation with added support for plugins). It's goal was to allow "modules" to be loaded in as a replacement for
some of the functionality provided by Bukkit. These modules were intended to be smaller pieces of code rather than
larger self-contained projects. This was born out of a desire to circumvent the method of class loading used in the
Bukkit project and to provide a more developer friendly way of defining certain properties. It favours using Java
annotations over the more traditional .yml configuration file approach.

### JSONDB <sup>[Source](https://github.com/parryjacob/JSONDB)</sup>

`JSONDB` is a dependency for `ModuleBukkit` for interacting with a database through a JSON serialization layer. It
quickly grew beyond this scope and became a more generalized database abstraction layer.

### Minecraft Plugins <sup>[Source](https://github.com/parryjacob/mc)</sup>

Over the course of more than one year, I worked together with my close friend [Evan McIntire](http://evanmcintire.com/)
to create a variety of plugins for multiple Minecraft servers at multiple gaming communities we were a part of. Their
appearance and functionality has changed wildly over time, their current version barely resembling the originals.

This was the first large project I ever worked on in a collaborative environment, and it remains one of the largest.
Memories of this project exist in many forms, both positive and negative. Sadly, after many changes within the Minecraft
community this project was unable to continue in its current form. It may return again one day, but only time will tell.
